            <li>
                Q: "Why does this app's color correction work better from some photos/videos than others?"
                <br> A: This app works best with smaller clips of underwater footage that were taken at a consistent depth & exposure. For longer videos, or videos in which the underwater depth or camera exposure were changing throughout the filming of the video, this app won't work as well (even with the 'Adaptive Mode' option). Additionally, for photos/videos taken above water, or for underwater footage that has already been color corrected or edited into a montage video, the results might look strange.

            <br>
            <li>
                Q: "Why can't I find my color corrected photos & videos in my photo library, or why do some photos/videos show up further back in my library?"
                <br> A: Currently, this app preserves any metadata associated with a photo/video. Not all photos/videos have metadata, but if you color correct one that has metadata that contains a creation date, then that date will be carried over to your newly corrected photo/video (and would therefore show up in your library by its date). Note, however, that all newly color corrected photos and videos will also be added to a 'SeaReal' album in your photo library.

            <li>
                Q: "What is 'Adaptive Mode'?"
                <br> A: When 'Adaptive' mode is on, the color correction logic for a given frame is determined by the most recent frames that came before it. Generally speaking, this option might be better for videos that a) Are longer in duration, b) Contain transitions (e.g. fade in from black), or c) Contain clips from different dives. When 'Adaptive' mode is off, the color correction logic for a given frame is determined by the first few frames of the video. Generally speaking, this option might be better for videos that a) Are shorter in duration, and b) Have colors, light exposure, and depth (at which the footage was taken) that are mostly consistent throughout its duration

            <li>
                Q: "When trying to save a color corrected video to my library, why has the progress bar stopped moving?"
                <br> A: This is a rare bug that we don't see often. For now, you might need to close the app and restart your iPhone if this happens, but it would also be helpful to contact us via email (listed below) to let us know if you've ever encountered this error.
